   - Copy and paste the contents of `test-functionality.js` into the console
   - Press Enter to run the tests
   - Check the results - you should see "ðŸŽ‰ All tests passed!"

### Method 2: Manual Testing

   - You should see:
     - Yellow highlighting on the selected text
     - A counter badge showing the number of keywords
     - Keywords appearing in the MatchMate popup interface

2. **Test Individual Keyword Capture**
   - Double-click on individual keywords
   - Right-click and use the MatchMate context menu
   - Check checkboxes next to keywords

3. **Verify Extension Communication**
   - Open the MatchMate popup (click the extension icon)
   - Captured keywords should appear in the interface
   - No error messages should appear in the console

## Expected Behaviors

âœ… **Text Selection**: Selecting multiple keywords shows yellow highlighting with counter badges
âœ… **Keyword Capture**: Selected keywords automatically appear in the MatchMate interface
âœ… **Error Handling**: No "Receiving end does not exist" errors in console
âœ… **Visual Feedback**: Success/error messages show appropriately
âœ… **Background Communication**: Seamless communication between all extension components

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. **Refresh the Page**: Sometimes a page refresh helps after extension updates
2. **Reload the Extension**: Go to `chrome://extensions/` and click the reload button
3. **Check Console**: Look for any remaining error messages in DevTools
4. **Test on Different Pages**: Try different Google Ads pages

## Technical Details

The fix addresses the root cause of the communication error by:
- Implementing proper extension lifecycle management
- Adding connection validation before message sending
- Using progressive retry strategies for failed communications
- Improving error recovery and user experience

The extension now handles temporary communication failures gracefully and provides better feedback to users when issues occur.
